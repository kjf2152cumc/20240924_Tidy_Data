Tidy data: 

What is it? 

An example of non tidy data is when treatment a and treatment b are variables and there are counts of each instead of variable treatment with options a or b. 

Relational data: 
  
  Data spread across tables with defined relations. Variables used to define
  these relations are keys. 
  
  Inner joins looks for overlap. Outer joins has x and brings in everything from 
  y. They can be left, right, or full. 
  
  They're called relational because they relate to each other through at least     one variable. 
  
Key functions: 

pivot_longer, seperate (single column with many variables), pivot_wider from long table format, bind_rows, *_join:
